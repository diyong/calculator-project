Creating a calculator

The simple JavaScript Calculator Project aimed to strengthen my understanding of event handling and simple data storage/manipulation. I used an array to store user inputs and created functions that would place, manipulate, and delete numbers according to user inputs. I have also bound the number pad on full size keyboards to their corresponding buttons on the calculator.

Additionally, I have learned more about window event handlers, timers, key codes, CSS Grid handling, and CSS animations through :after and @keyframes.

In the future, I would like to go back and rework how the calculator handles equations. Currently, I have eval() looking at the stored inputs. I realize that eval() may not be the most efficient or secure method of going about functionality. I plan on creating additional functions which would take the operators and numbers to come a result following the order of operations.
